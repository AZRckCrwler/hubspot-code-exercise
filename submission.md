## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

- Much more compotentization. I did provide some examples, but would have
    done more, like broken up multiselect into a repeatable function.
- Further browser compatibility instead of just latest
- accessibility updates
- more interaction with filters, dropdowns
- animations/transistions when filtering data
-


## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

- I don't believe I deviated, but instead of using SASS/SCSS, I opted for PostCSS
    with plugins of desired SASS features as it increases build speed to not use
    SASS preproccesors with the Vite service.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

- I decided to test out Vue 3 with stronger TS typing than I had done at
    my previous job. Definitely enjoyed it, but it did slow me down reviewing
    newer documentation than if I had just stayed with Parcel and did Exercise
    #2 in vanilla JS.
- I was taking more programattic approaches with my Vue code and components,
    however, I had to start making sacrifices for the sake of time.
- I used several different methods of solving CSS/HTML/JS as an attempt to
    demostrate comfortability jumping around development styles as needed.
    If I were in charge of a project instead of interviewing, I would have
    picked specific paths and aimed for consistency.
